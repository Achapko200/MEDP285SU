    <h4>What do you hope to learn in this class?</h4>
  <p>I hope to deepen my understanding of how code and creativity intersect in media production. I want to strengthen both my technical and design skills, especially in building interactive, visually engaging content for the web.</p>

  <h4>Do you have experience with coding (html, css, javascript)?</h4>
  <p>Yes, I have experience with HTML and CSS. I haven’t worked much with JavaScript yet, but I’m a Computer Science major, so I’m looking forward to learning more.</p>

  <h4>Do you have a media production superpower (Photoshop, Photography, Animation, Illustration, etc.)?</h4>
  <p>No, I don’t have a media production superpower yet, but I’m excited to learn and improve my skills in this class.</p>
